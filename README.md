This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML related to using the `innerHTML` property.  The issue arises from providing a non-string value to `innerHTML`. While some browsers might handle this silently, others might throw exceptions or produce unexpected results. The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, while `solution.html` presents the corrected version using proper string conversion.
